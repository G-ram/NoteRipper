#NoteRipper

NoteRipper rips Sparknotes from the site and formats them, removing adds and making it easier to print them out.

#Setup and Use
The .jar file should not be moved from the folder. Simply click on it and wait for it to launch. Navigate to the "contents" page of a book on the Sparknotes site (Ex: [Lord of the Rings](http://www.sparknotes.com/film/lordoftherings/)) and copy and paste url into program's url field. Then click generate. Formatting may not be entirely correct.

####Note: This program has only been tested on a Mac; compatibility with Windows and Linux may be limited.
